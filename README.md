# 🚗 Car Price Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts the resale price of a car based on its specifications, features, and history. The system trains a Random Forest Regressor model on historical automotive data and serves real-time predictions via a production-ready Flask interface deployed in the cloud.

## 📂 Production Directory Architecture
The repository is engineered according to institutional production guidelines, strictly separating static client UI assets from data matrix operations:

## 📊 Dataset & Feature Alignment

The machine learning pipeline utilizes the **Vehicle Dataset from CarDekho** (sourced dynamically from Kaggle). The following features are processed, mapped into numerical fields, and evaluated by the mathematical boundaries of the model:

| Feature Name | Type | Description / Mapped Space |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Present Price** | Continuous | Current showroom valuation of the vehicle (in Lakhs) |
| **Kilometers Driven** | Discrete | Total numeric mileage history of the car |
| **Fuel Type** | Categorical | Mapped Target Vectors: `Petrol: 0`, `Diesel: 1`, `CNG: 2` |
| **Seller Type** | Categorical | Mapped Target Vectors: `Dealer: 0`, `Individual: 1` |
| **Transmission** | Categorical | Mapped Target Vectors: `Manual: 0`, `Automatic: 1` |
| **Owners History** | Discrete | Integer count of previous registered owners |
| **Car Age** | Continuous | Transformed temporal matrix calculated from the build year |

## ⚙️ How to Setup and Run Locally

Follow these instructions to establish an isolated local environment and execute the application:

### 1. Environment Setup & Component Installation

Open your terminal inside the root directory and activate your target environment manager:

```bash
# Create an isolated Conda workspace environment
conda create -n carprice python=3.10 -y
conda activate carprice

# Install the exact production ecosystem dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 2. Run the Machine Learning Pipeline

If you wish to re-train the underlying architecture and build the serialized prediction file, invoke the pipeline execution script:

```bash
python train.py

```

### 3. Launch the Local Development Engine

Initiate the Flask server microkernel locally:

```bash
python app.py

```

Once initialized, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` inside your browser to interact with the application locally.

## 🚀 Live Cloud Deployment

The architecture is configured for continuous delivery via Git tracking connected directly to a cloud infrastructure cluster hosted on **Render**:

* The production server boots up efficiently using a standard Linux container layer execution guided by the entry rules defined inside the project `Procfile`.
* All connections parse clean `POST` form request arrays, routing calculations safely away from client viewpoints directly through the cloud-based `car_price_model.pkl` matrix without any hardcoded fallback conditions.
